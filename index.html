                    Hello, my name is Ted (Yun Ki) Jang. I am a recent graduate from Langara College and I'm currently looking for a job that will help me gain experience as I code. 
                    I was one of those generic gamer kids in highschool, but quite competitive and successful in the gaming field. I met and played against professional gamers in every
                    competitive games I've played. Such as League of Legends, CS:GO, Overwatch, Fortnite, etc. Needless to say, I earned money from all of these games, from local tournaments
                    to major ones, biggest ones being Fortnite Winter Royale 2018 for $1,000,000. The reason why I was so good at games and enjoy coding is because I love the iterative aspect
                    between the two. Every game and coding, it would require need a slight change to provide different results. These small changes and results would always drive me to make more
                    of these changes leading to success. My main goal is to become a solid coder who is able to code his own game one day for public.
                    </p>

                    Location: Vancouver, BC <br><br>
                    I started attending Langara College on September 2016 pursing Art as my major being interested in drawing at the time.
                    However around 2018 I decided to switch my major towards Computer Science since I was also very interested in technology and how they were
                    making changes toward the current environment.
                    <br>
                    At Langara, the teacher were great at teaching me the basics about computers and coding, at the start I enjoyed and excelled in most classes.

                            <b>C++</b>  is the language I am the most comfortable and skilled with. It was the language that was taught to me the most in school with most of my assignments requiring it.

                        <li>
                            <b>JavaScript</b> is one of the basic language I was required to learn during my first year at Langara. I was able to refresh it when writing scripts with html websites. But it wasn't so different from C++.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>Python</b> is a language that I'm not as experience with, but can see myself being able to enjoy it. As some basic things from variables to loops are different from C++, it is a bit hard to get used to, but there are some tools that makes me prefer this program.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>SQL</b> is a tool that helped me create my hotel website program. It was mainly used for database project, however it wasn't too difficult to learn as the teacher at Langara made it easy to learn the syntax.

                        <li>
                            <b>HTML5</b> is probably one of the most used language when creating this and Peter Please website. I have used this language for around a week, and overall, I feel that I've gotten quite the grasp on it with CSS.
